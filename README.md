Here is my responsive portfolio. In this assignment, I worked on writing semantic HTML while incorporating bootstrap into my code. I was able to use the bootstrap features like the grid and navbar to achieve my goals for my portfolio. This is a responsive website; therefore, it will adapt to various browsers and their sizes of screens.
